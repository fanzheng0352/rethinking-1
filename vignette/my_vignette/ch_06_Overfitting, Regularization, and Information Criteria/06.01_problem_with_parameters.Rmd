## Overview: 

Adding parameters will always improve a model's fit as measured by *R^2^*.

```{r global options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.align='center', 
  #dpi = 150, 
  include=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE
)
```

```{r packages and parameters}
library(magrittr)
library(modelr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r r2, echo=FALSE, out.width="400px", include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static/images/r2_explained.png"))

```

```{r r2v2, echo=FALSE, out.width="200px", include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("static/images/r_squared_formula.png"))

```

The underfitting-overfitting problem is often described as the bias-variance trade-off. 

## Takeawys
Adding parameters will always improve a model's fit as measured by *R^2^*, but it will produce overfit models that predict poorly. Underfit models will be insensitive to their data. These pressures need to be balanced to build the most informative models.
