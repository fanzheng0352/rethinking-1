# 2.3.1 Likelihood function
The likelihood function specifies the plausibility of the data. 

For instance if we observed 6 water in 9 globe tosses, we can use the binomial distribution to calculate the plausibility of such data under any value of *p*.

# 2.3.2 Parameters
Any input to the likelihood function may be a quantity we wish to estimate from data, AKA a parameter. In our case, *n* & *w* are known from data, while *p* remains to be estimated. 

We often add additional parameters inside the likelihood function such as average differences b/w treatment groups, association b/w treatment and outcome, dependence of treatment effects on covariate(s), etc. 

# 2.3.3 Prior
You must provide a prior for every parameter you intend to estimate. This is an important point I had not previously grasped.
